## üçé What is dotAPNS?
[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/dotAPNS?style=plastic)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/dotAPNS/ "NuGet")	[![Master build status](https://img.shields.io/travis/alexalok/dotAPNS/master?style=plastic)](https://travis-ci.org/alexalok/dotAPNS/ "Master build status")

dotAPNS is a small library used to send pushes to Apple devices via the [HTTP/2 APNs API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server), which is an officially recommended way of interacting with APNs (*Apple Push Notification service*).

dotAPNS itself targets **netstandard2.0**, while dotAPNS ASP.NET Core integration library targets **netcoreapp3.0**. The latter, however, is not needed to use the main library - it just provides some infrastructure helpers to ease the integration of the library into ASP.NET Core projects.



## üõ†Ô∏è How to use it?

1. Register your app with APNs [(?)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/registering_your_app_with_apns)
2. Decide whether you will use [certificate-based](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/establishing_a_certificate-based_connection_to_apns) or [token-based](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/establishing_a_token-based_connection_to_apns) connection to APNs. Token-based is easier since you won't have to perform any certificate conversions. For specific instructions, see below.
3. Start sending pushes!

## üìÉ Certificate-based connection

```c#
var apns = ApnsClient.CreateUsingCert("voip.p12");
```
or
```c#
var cert = new X509Certificate2("voip.p12");
var apns = ApnsClient.CreateUsingCert(cert);
```

Change `voip.p12` so that it points to the certificate you are intended to use.

**Note:** dotAPNS supports certificates only in x509 format. You might have to convert the certificate you download from Developer Center to the supported format.

## üîè Token-based connection

First, you need to specify some options that the library will use to create an authentication token:

```c#
var options = new ApnsJwtOptions() 
{
    BundleId = "bundle", 
    CertContent = "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\r\nMIGTA ... -----END PRIVATE KEY-----", 
    // CertFilePath = "secret.p8", // use either CertContent or CertFilePath, not both
    KeyId = "key", 
    TeamId = "team"
});
```

`BundleId` - your app‚Äôs bundle ID. Should not include specific topics (i.e. `com.myapp` but not `com.myapp.voip`).

`CertFilePath` - path to the .p8 certificate you have downloaded from the Developer Center.

`CertContent` - contents of the .p8 certificate. If specified, `CertFilePath` **must not be set**. This option allows you to use the library without having to store the actual certificate file. Contents may include everything in the certificate file (even the `BEGIN/END PRIVATE KEY` lines) or just the base64-encoded body, with or without line breaks (both `\r\n` and `\r` are supported ). 

`KeyId` - The 10-character Key ID you obtained from your developer account [(?)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/establishing_a_token-based_connection_to_apns#2943371).

`TeamId` - The 10-character Team ID you use for developing your company‚Äôs apps. Obtain this value from your developer account.

Once you've gathered all the information needed and created an options instance, it's time to call

```c#
var options = new ApnsJwtOptions() { ... };
var apns = ApnsClient.CreateUsingJwt(new HttpClient(), options);
```

Note that the library *requires* you to supply `HttpClient` instance - this is done so that you can manage its lifecycle. Please see [this article](https://aspnetmonsters.com/2016/08/2016-08-27-httpclientwrong/) to learn more about why this is important. Also note that certificate-based connection method does not support `HttpClient` injection as of moment of writing.

**üéâYou're now all set to start sending pushes!üéâ**

## üîî Send a push

To send the most basic alert notifications you might use the following code:

```c#
var options = new ApnsJwtOptions() { ... };
var apns = ApnsClient.CreateUsingJwt(new HttpClient(), options); 
var push = ApplePush
    .CreateAlert(new ApplePushAlert("title", "body"))
    .AddToken("token");

var response = await apns.Send(push);
if(response?.IsSuccessful == true)
    Console.WriteLine("Alert push was successfully sent!")
else if(response?.IsSuccessful == false)
    Console.WriteLine("Cannot send push, error: " + response.ReasonString);
else if(response?.IsSuccessful == null)
    Console.WriteLine("Cannot send push because APNs service is unreachable.");
```

# dotAPNS ASP.NET Core integration

**dotAPNS.AspNetCore** is a library containing **ApnsService** class and some helpers methods to simplify its usage.

**ApnsService** is a class that is supposed to be consumed by controllers or other services of ASP.NET Core application. It is expected to be registered as a singleton.

**ApnsService** provides caching - it will reuse ApnsClients created earlier if they have the same certificate thumbprint (for certificate-based connections) or the same bundle id (for token-based connections). At the moment of writing cached ApnsClients never expire and there is no way to make them expire manually. 

**Note: at the moment of writing caching cannot be disabled for ApnsService!**

You can register ApnsService automatically within your application by calling

`services.AddApns();` in `ConfigureServices` method of your `Startup` class:

```c#
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
	services.AddRazorPages();
	services.AddApns(); // <-- this call registers ApnsService
    // ...
}
```

`AddApns` does the following:

1. Registers named HttpClient with name `dotAPNS`.
2. Registers **ApnsClientFactory** as a singleton - this is the factory used by ApnsService to create ApnsClient instances.
3. Registers **ApnsService** as a singleton itself.



After registering, you can inject the ApnsService into any controller:

```c#
readonly IApnsService _apnsService;

public MyController(IApnsService apnsService)
{
	_apnsService = apnsService;
}
```

**Note:  you need to inject the interface (IApnsService), not the type itself!**

 

IApnsService defines 4 methods that can be used to send pushes:

```c#
Task<ApnsResponse> SendPush(ApplePush push, X509Certificate2 cert);

Task<ApnsResponse> SendPush(ApplePush push, ApnsJwtOptions jwtOptions);

Task<List<ApnsResponse>> SendPushes(IReadOnlyCollection<ApplePush> pushes, X509Certificate2 cert);

Task<List<ApnsResponse>> SendPushes(IReadOnlyCollection<ApplePush> pushes, ApnsJwtOptions jwtOptions);
```

For example, the following code can be used to send a simple [background](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/pushing_background_updates_to_your_app) push:

```c#
 var push = ApplePush
     .CreateContentAvailable()
     .AddToken("token");
var options = new ApnsJwtOptions() { ... };
var response = await _apnsService.SendPush(push, options);
```
